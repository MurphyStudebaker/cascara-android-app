# Cascara Coffee Shop App
This is the final project for my Android Development and Database Management courses. You can read about the process of building this application at https://medium.com/@murphystude/promoting-coffee-culture-with-a-mobile-app-31162ba11989.

# Set Up
The app will run without connection to the database if you log in with the username and password "root." However, no data will be displayed. 
To view the application as it is intended to function (that is, with a database connection) complete the following steps:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Transfer the API files to the main directory of an AMP stack local development server.
3. Create a MySQL database on the local server and import the SQL contents of the DATA folder.
4. Add a new file in API/includes called "Constants.php" and define your database credentials.
5. Modify the IP address in the Android files to point to the IP of your local server.
